## Vocabulary alignment

VOCAB.md is the source of truth for all project terminology.

All project descriptions, CLI help strings, documentation, and skill files must use terminology consistent with VOCAB.md.

When VOCAB.md is updated, propagate changes to every file that references vit's vocabulary in the same commit.
