## Vocabulary alignment

docs/VOCAB.md is the source of truth for all project terminology.

All project descriptions, CLI help strings, documentation, and skill files must use terminology consistent with docs/VOCAB.md.

When docs/VOCAB.md is updated, propagate changes to every file that references vit's vocabulary in the same commit.
