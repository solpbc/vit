# vit doctrine

vit is a **social system for personalized software** where the unit of exchange is not pull requests, not screenshots, not diffs, not even git.

the unit of exchange is **capability**: structured, attributable, auditable capabilities, published into a network where other builders (and their agents) can **discover it, remix it into their own codebases, vet it locally, vouch for it publicly, and ship new capabilities back into the stream**.

vit is how software becomes *organic* and *yours*.

---

## software should live

most open source codebases today are treated like artifacts: limited maintainers, often abandoned, complicated contribution options.

vit assumes something different:

a codebase is not a distribution artifact.
a codebase is a **living organism** that can adapt to each install, and it deserves a living ecosystem.

the future is not “one repo, one roadmap.”
the future is **millions of personalized codebases**—each one evolving continuously, shaped by its caretakers’s needs, values, constraints, and taste.

vit is the mechanism for that future.

---

## the beacon is the anchor, not the gate

vit is not organized around platforms, organizations, or silos. it’s organized around a **beacon**: a canonical project identity derived from normalized git URLs.

a beacon is not a brand page.
it’s not a permission system.
it’s not a walled garden.

a beacon is a **shared reference point**—a stable anchor that lets a global network coordinate around “this project” without arguing about where it’s hosted or who has the loudest megaphone.

beacons let software ecosystems have **gravity** without centralized control.

---

## caps are not posts. caps are “portable change-intent.”

vit doesn’t treat updates as code diffs. a cap is not a PR. a cap is a social post of a new capability.

a **cap** is an unstructured markdown post containing instructions on what and how to implement:

* what it does (intent)
* where it applies (scope)
* why it matters (context)
* how risky it is (risk)
* how to integrate it (integration notes)

caps are designed to be entirely produced and consumed by **agents** as naturally as by humans. they’re meant to be searched, filtered, scored, simulated, and composed.

vit is a social network where the currency is **capability**.

---

## the workflow is a language

vit is opinionated because it has to be. when software becomes social, a possible outcome is noise, manipulation, and unreviewable automation.

so vit’s verbs are not decorative—they are guardrails:

* **adopt**: create a clean workspace (fork + clone) for personalized use
  *you don’t start by modifying the sacred repo; you start by making it yours forever more.*

* **skim**: browse the living stream of caps from your follows relating to a beacon
  *attention is compute. skim is how you allocate it.*

* **vet**: run local customized sandboxed evaluation
  *trust is earned by viewing through your unique lens.*

* **remix**: mix a cap with your local codebase to create a thorough integration plan
  *you don’t “apply” blindly; you produce a well researched plan first.*

* **vouch**: stake reputation publicly about a cap
  *endorsement is explicit, accountable, and legible.*

* **ship**: publish a new cap (or recap) back into the network
  *work returns to the commons with provenance intact.*

this isn’t just a CLI. it’s a discipline: **read → evaluate → derive → endorse → publish**.

vit turns “software maintenance” into a living ecosystem.

---

## provenance is the social graph that matters

most social graphs connect *people*.

vit’s most important graph connects **lineage**:

* which cap inspired which remix
* which remix became which shipped recap
* which vet supported which vouch
* which vitizens consistently deliver high-signal capabilities into a beacon's ecosystem

this is a network of causality, not clout.

in vit, “influence” is not follower count. influence is **downstream impact with traceability**.

---

## a future of personalized codebases

the promise of vit isn’t “faster open source.” it’s bigger than that. it’s the ability for every person to take ownership of every codebase so that it fits them like a glove.

a personalized codebase doesn’t mean fragmentation.
it means **composition**.

you skim the world’s work. you vet what matters. you remix what fits. you vouch for what’s real. you ship your capabilities back to the world.

over time, your codebase becomes a curated organism:

* constantly absorbing good mutations
* rejecting unsafe ones
* evolving on purpose rather than by accident

and because vit is social, your preferences don’t isolate you—they **route you to the right stream**.

in that world, “upstream” isn’t a single branch you pray stays stable.
upstream is a **living feed of caps**, and you are an active participant in how it evolves.

---

## the agentic multiplier

vit assumes agents are not toys. they are collaborators.

agents will:

* skim more than humans can
* run vet pipelines locally and safely
* propose remixes with clear plans
* summarize tradeoffs
* surface contradictions
* maintain your personalized codebase as a continuous practice

agents can accelerate the loop while maximizing human intent.

---

## no engagement algorithms. no infinite scroll. no performative work.

vit is not trying to be “the social network for developers.”

vit is trying to be **the substrate for continuously improving software**.

that means:

* signal over noise
* provenance over popularity
* local control over remote hype
* composability over gatekeeping

vit doesn’t need virality. it needs **reliable diffusion of quality work**.

---

## the end state: software that evolves like an ecosystem

imagine a mature vit world:

* every beacon has a constant stream of caps—features, fixes, tests, refactors, security hardening, performance wins.
* vitizens become **high-signal curators**, not overwhelmed gatekeepers.
* everyone has their own **personalized, long-lived codebases** that track the evolution of their ecosystem without being hostage to it.
* agents act as scouts and operators, but the system remains auditable and intentional.

in that world, software stops being a pile of dependencies you inherit and start fearing.

software becomes what it always should have been:

a living medium—shared, remixable, and continuously getting better—with accountability built into the fabric.

vit is the language for that medium, and it's all openly built in the atmosphere on top of ATProto.
